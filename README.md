## Description
This is a toy project made in the context of Deezer's internal 2018 Hackathon.
The idea was to create some personalised piece of art from users' listening data.
It has been made with Processing library : https://processing.org/
Inspiration : https://mymodernmet.com/classical-music-data-visualizations-nicholas-rougeux/

## How to use
3 data inputs example have been put in the /data folder.
These are csv tables with 4 columns, representing day, hour, amount of listen in this context and genre of the listen. However, it could literally represent anything.

Just change the INPUT_FILE in the processing script, and run it with Processing IDE (I'm on 3.3.5 but any should do)
For the .mp4 output you might need to download ffmpeg drivers.

An example of postprocessed output is available here :
